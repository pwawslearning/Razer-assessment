# 🌍 Global Payment Service Microservices Deployment

This project outlines the deployment strategy for a globally distributed **payment service** using **Kubernetes**. It focuses on delivering **high availability**, **scalability**, **security**, and **observability** across all microservices involved in the architecture.

---

## 🚀 Technology Stack

- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Networking**: Cilium / Calico / Cisco ACI
- **Autoscaling**: Kubernetes HPA
- **Security**: Kubernetes Network Policies, Namespaces

---

## 🔐 Security

- Logical separation of services using **Kubernetes Namespaces** for isolation.
- Fine-grained **NetworkPolicies** enforce communication rules between services.
- Container-level network control using advanced **CNI plugins** like:
  - Cilium (eBPF based)
  - Calico
  - Cisco ACI

---

## 🔁 High Availability / Reliability

- High availability is achieved using **Kubernetes Deployments** with multiple **replicas**.
- In case of failure, Kubernetes automatically restarts and redistributes pods.
- Can integrate with **multi-zone** or **multi-region** cluster setups for geo-redundancy.

---

## 📈 Scalability

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** automatically scales pods based on:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Custom metrics (e.g., queue size, request rate)
- Works seamlessly with **Cluster Autoscaler** for dynamic node provisioning.

---

## 📊 Observability (Coming Soon)

Planned integration with:
- **Prometheus + Grafana** for metrics and dashboards.

---

## 📦 Future Enhancements

- Add support for **CI/CD pipeline** using ArgoCD or GitHub Actions.
- Implement **multi-region failover** and **traffic steering** using Global Load Balancers (e.g., AWS Global Accelerator).
- Full observability stack with alerts and tracing.
