## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

1. **AWS account**: For deployment ECR on AWS cloud with least of privillage
2. **Install awscli and secret_key & access_key**: securely connect to AWS resources.
3. **Docker**: Docker hub account to pull public images.
---

## Architecture
- **AWS Secret manager** Create secret to connect with Docker hub by using access token.
- **IAM policy**: To pull image from upstream registry, the user who need to grant ECR registry permission.
- **ECR with Pull-Through Cache**: Configured to cache images from Docker Hub as an upstream registry.
- **Docker container**: To deploy the web server as a container.
- **Nginx Load Balancer**: To provide high availability and scalability for incoming traffic to backend servers and mediate between clients requests and servers by distributing incoming traffic equally among servers.
---

## Implementation
1. **Create aws secret with docker access token**:
  - username = docker username
  - access Token= docker registry>> account setting>>personal access tokens>>Generate new token

2. **Define specific upstream registry and namespace**:

  - After setting up pull through cache, validate the created rule.

3. **Pull imagefrom upstream registry and to ECR private registry**

  - Pull image from docker hub by aws cli as ECR provided pull commands.

- **Deploy web server on docker containers by using docker compose**:
  _docker compose file_
```
